# head-complexity

Lean 4 formalization of the head-complexity results for one-layer attention. The
definitions and theorems mirror the informal proofs in the top-level `theorems/` writeups.

## Status: twelve formalized theorems and one separation counterexample

Every theorem in `theorems/01_foundations_and_normal_form/` (L1–L12) is machine-checked
for **general `n`**, with no `sorry`/`admit`, depending only on the three standard
Lean axioms `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (the full build runs a
`#print axioms` gate). `H*` is `HStar` (the least number of heads realizing `f`).
The explicit counterexample in `theorems/02_separations_and_counterexamples/` is
machine-checked as Theorem 13.

The separations layer is also complete: the Lean 4.31 Warren producer is
integrated in-tree, so the Warren-to-NDISJ chain has no proof placeholders and
depends only on `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Depends on [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) (version pinned
in `lakefile.toml`). Build with:

```bash
lake exe cache get   # fetch prebuilt mathlib (first time only)
lake build
lake build HeadComplexity.Examples.All   # optional build for just examples
lake build HeadComplexity.Results.All   # optional build for just results
```

For **exact, reproducible** build/verify instructions — including the
mathlib-cache `curl` fix, the Snellius SLURM job scripts, and how to confirm the
results are axiom-clean — see [`BUILDING.md`](BUILDING.md).
